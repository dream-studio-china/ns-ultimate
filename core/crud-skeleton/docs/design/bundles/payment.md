# Payment Bundle Design

> Payment module design for invoice-based payment orchestration.
> The first implementation MUST provide a generic payment framework, not provider-specific Fuiou/Huifu code.
> Fuiou and Huifu are referenced only as proven legacy architecture inputs for future gateway adapters.

---

## 1. Scope

### 1.1 Goal

The Payment module provides a unified invoice abstraction for all payment flows:

| Capability | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| Invoice creation | Represent a payable business document independent of payment provider |
| Gateway dispatch | Route pay/notify/refund actions to a named gateway adapter |
| Payment adjustments | Allow other modules to apply pre-payment adjustments before gateway payment |
| State management | Enforce legal invoice status transitions |
| Webhook handling | Verify provider callbacks and update invoices idempotently |
| Cross-module events | Notify business modules such as Trade when invoices are paid/refunded |

### 1.2 Non-Goals For First Phase

The first phase MUST NOT include concrete Fuiou/Huifu integration code.

| Excluded | Reason |
|----------|--------|
| Fuiou/Huifu real API clients | Requires provider credentials, SDK/runtime validation, and separate certification |
| Provider account onboarding | Belongs to a later provider submodule phase |
| POS device management | Provider-specific operational module, not core invoice framework |
| Auto withdraw / settlement | Finance and settlement concern, not first-phase payment collection |
| Split settlement / fees | Requires accounting design beyond invoice payment |
| Multi-invoice aggregate payment | Too much orchestration complexity for first phase; use one invoice with adjustments instead |
| Multiple adjustment types | First adjustment implementation only supports wallet balance deduction for a specific currency |
| Payment requisition | Outbound payment approval workflow, separate from collection invoices |

### 1.3 Legacy Reference

The legacy `farm-neighbor` implementation provides useful concepts:

| Legacy Concept | Keep | Adaptation |
|----------------|------|------------|
| `Invoice` as central payment document | Yes | Modern PHP 8 entity, int cents, string statuses |
| `outTradeNo` unique system trade number | Yes | Keep as external payment number |
| `transactionId` provider trade id | Yes | Keep nullable until provider confirms |
| `scene` for business scenario | Yes | Use with `sourceType/sourceId` |
| `payment/gateway/tradeType` separation | Yes | Keep for provider routing and reporting |
| `extraData` for provider payload | Yes | Store sanitized payload snapshots only |
| `PayStrategy` `pay/notify/refund` shape | Yes | Replace with tagged `PaymentGatewayInterface` services |
| `InvoiceAdditionalService` scene dispatch | Partially | Replace with Symfony events |
| Dynamic `new $paymentClassName` | No | Use DI registry and explicit service tags |
| Doctrine listener business side effects | No | Use service methods and domain events |
| DBAL direct insert/update | No | Use Doctrine entities through services |
| Gateway code returning `die()` or raw response from service | No | Controller responder owns HTTP response |

---

## 2. Module Boundary

### 2.1 Module Location

```
src/Payment/
|-- Controller/
|   |-- App/InvoiceController.php
|   |-- Manage/InvoiceController.php
|   |-- Webhook/PaymentNotifyController.php
|-- Entity/Invoice.php
|-- Repository/InvoiceRepository.php
|-- Service/InvoiceService.php
|-- Service/InvoiceServiceInterface.php
|-- Service/PaymentGatewayInterface.php
|-- Service/PaymentGatewayRegistry.php
|-- Service/Adjustment/PaymentAdjustmentProviderInterface.php

|-- Event/InvoiceFailedEvent.php
|-- Exception/InvoiceInvalidTransitionException.php
|-- Exception/PaymentGatewayNotFoundException.php
|-- Exception/PaymentVerificationException.php
|-- Resources/config/services_payment.yaml
```

### 2.2 Dependency Direction

| From | To | Allowed | Rule |
|------|----|---------|------|
| Payment | Core | Yes | BaseService, RestController, serializer, events |
| Payment | Identity | Yes | Optional payer relation or current user lookup |
| Payment | Wallet | No | Payment defines extension points but MUST NOT import wallet services or entities |
| Payment | Trade | No | Payment MUST NOT import Trade services or entities |
| Trade | Payment | Yes | Trade consumes `InvoiceServiceInterface` and Payment events |
| Wallet | Payment | Yes | Wallet may provide payment gateways and adjustment providers |
| Gateway adapters | Payment | Yes | Implement `PaymentGatewayInterface` |
| Adjustment providers | Payment | Yes | Implement `PaymentAdjustmentProviderInterface` |

Payment is a generic collection module. Business modules decide how to react to invoice events.
Wallet balance deduction belongs to Wallet as a provider implementation. Payment only orchestrates generic adjustments.

---

## 3. Invoice Domain Model

### 3.1 Entity Contract

**File**: `src/Payment/Entity/Invoice.php`

**Namespace**: `App\Payment\Entity`

**Table**: `payment_invoice`

Invoice is the aggregate root for a payable document. It is not owned by Trade, Wallet, or any gateway provider.

### 3.2 Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `id` | int | Yes | Internal primary key |
| `uuid` | string(36) | Yes | Public stable identifier |
| `outTradeNo` | string(64) | Yes | Unique system payment number sent to providers |
| `transactionId` | ?string(128) | No | Provider transaction id after payment succeeds |
| `sourceType` | string(50) | Yes | Business source, e.g. `trade_order` |
| `sourceId` | string(64) | Yes | Source id, preferably source UUID |
| `scene` | string(50) | Yes | Business scenario, e.g. `order`, `deposit`, `wallet_topup` |
| `payment` | ?string(50) | No | Gateway adapter name, e.g. `wallet`, `mock` |
| `gateway` | ?string(50) | No | Provider sub-gateway or channel |
| `tradeType` | ?string(50) | No | Provider trade type such as `jsapi`, `h5`, `pos` |
| `status` | string(30) | Yes | Workflow marking |
| `amount` | int | Yes | Payable amount in cents |
| `refundedAmount` | int | Yes | Refunded amount in cents |
| `currency` | string(10) | Yes | ISO-like currency code, default `CNY` |
| `payer` | ?User | No | Optional payer relation |
| `subject` | ?string(255) | No | Provider-visible subject/title |
| `description` | ?string | No | Human-readable details |
| `extraData` | ?array | No | Sanitized provider/business metadata |
| `createdAt` | DateTimeImmutable | Yes | Creation timestamp |
| `paidAt` | ?DateTimeImmutable | No | Payment completion timestamp |
| `cancelledAt` | ?DateTimeImmutable | No | Cancellation timestamp |
| `refundedAt` | ?DateTimeImmutable | No | Full refund timestamp |
| `updatedAt` | ?DateTimeImmutable | No | Last update timestamp |

### 3.3 Status Constants

```php
public const STATUS_PENDING = 'pending';
public const STATUS_PAYING = 'paying';
public const STATUS_PAID = 'paid';
public const STATUS_FAILED = 'failed';
public const STATUS_CANCELLED = 'cancelled';
public const STATUS_PARTIAL_REFUNDED = 'partial_refunded';
public const STATUS_REFUNDED = 'refunded';
```

### 3.4 Scene Constants

```php
public const SCENE_ORDER = 'order';
public const SCENE_DEPOSIT = 'deposit';
public const SCENE_WALLET_TOPUP = 'wallet_topup';
```

Only `SCENE_ORDER` is required in the first phase. Other scene constants exist to keep the framework extensible.

### 3.5 Payment Constants

```php
public const PAYMENT_MOCK = 'mock';
public const PAYMENT_WALLET = 'wallet';
public const PAYMENT_WECHAT = 'wechat';
```

Provider constants such as `fuiou`, `fuiou-pos`, `huifu`, and `huifu-pos` are reserved for future adapters. They MUST NOT be used until concrete adapters exist.

### 3.6 Constraints

| Constraint | Requirement |
|------------|-------------|
| `uuid` | Unique |
| `outTradeNo` | Unique |
| `sourceType + sourceId + status` | Indexed |
| `sourceType + sourceId + scene` | Indexed |
| `payment + transactionId` | Indexed, nullable transaction id |
| `amount` | `>= 0` |
| `refundedAmount` | `>= 0`, `<= amount` |

### 3.7 Amount Contract

All invoice amounts MUST be stored as integer cents.

`Invoice::amount` MUST represent the gross business payable amount, not the external gateway charge amount. If pre-payment adjustments are applied, the gateway charge amount is computed as:

```text
gatewayPayAmount = invoice.amount - sum(applied adjustments)
```

| Direction | Format |
|-----------|--------|
| Entity storage | int cents |
| Service DTO | int cents |
| External API request | decimal string or number accepted, converted in service/controller |
| Provider payload | provider-specific, converted at gateway boundary |

Gateway adapters are responsible for converting cents into provider formats such as yuan decimal strings or fen integers.

### 3.8 Adjustment Domain Boundary

Payment does not own wallet deduction internals. Payment owns only the invoice and the generic adjustment contract used to reduce the amount that must be processed by a gateway.

Wallet balance deduction is a Wallet module concern because it is implemented through wallet balance transfer and reversal. The Wallet module MAY persist its own deduction entity, for example `PaymentDeduction`, with wallet transaction ids, idempotency references, and operational metadata.

Business modules such as Trade should continue to react to invoice events and should not know adjustment or deduction internals.

First-phase implementation supports only one wallet balance deduction per invoice and per currency through a Wallet-provided adjustment provider.

#### Adjustment Result Contract

An applied adjustment returned to Payment MUST expose only generic payment-facing fields:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `provider` | string | Yes | Adjustment provider name, e.g. `wallet_balance` |
| `amount` | int | Yes | Applied amount in cents |
| `currency` | string | Yes | Must equal invoice currency |
| `referenceId` | string | Yes | Provider idempotency reference |
| `payload` | array | No | Sanitized metadata safe to store on invoice extra data |

Payment MUST NOT require wallet transaction ids or wallet entity references in the generic adjustment result. Those details belong to Wallet.

#### Full Wallet Deduction

When adjustments cover the full invoice amount, no external provider gateway should be called. Payment MAY record `invoice.payment = wallet` when the only adjustment is wallet balance deduction, and can mark the invoice paid after the adjustment is applied successfully.

---

## 4. Invoice State Machine

### 4.1 Workflow Requirement

Invoice MUST use Symfony Workflow as a `state_machine`.

**File**: `config/packages/workflow.yaml`

```yaml
framework:
    workflows:
        invoice:
            type: 'state_machine'
            marking_store:
                type: 'method'
                property: 'status'
            supports:
                - App\Payment\Entity\Invoice
            initial_marking: pending
            places:
                - pending
                - paying
                - paid
                - failed
                - cancelled
                - partial_refunded
                - refunded
            transitions:
                start_pay:
                    from: pending
                    to: paying
                mark_paid:
                    from: [pending, paying]
                    to: paid
                fail:
                    from: [pending, paying]
                    to: failed
                cancel:
                    from: [pending, paying, failed]
                    to: cancelled
                partial_refund:
                    from: paid
                    to: partial_refunded
                refund:
                    from: [paid, partial_refunded]
                    to: refunded
```

### 4.2 Transition Ownership

| Transition | Called By | When |
|------------|-----------|------|
| `start_pay` | `InvoiceService::pay()` | Gateway payment request starts |
| `mark_paid` | `InvoiceService::markPaid()` | Gateway confirms success or wallet transfer succeeds |
| `fail` | `InvoiceService::markFailed()` | Gateway confirms terminal failure |
| `cancel` | `InvoiceService::cancel()` | User/admin/system cancels unpaid invoice |
| `partial_refund` | `InvoiceService::refund()` | Refund amount is less than remaining paid amount |
| `refund` | `InvoiceService::refund()` | Refund completes the full paid amount |

Controllers and gateway adapters MUST NOT call `$invoice->setStatus()` directly.

### 4.3 Idempotency Rules

| Event | Current Status | Behavior |
|-------|----------------|----------|
| Duplicate paid notify | `paid` | Return success without re-dispatching business event |
| Paid notify after `cancelled` | `cancelled` | Reject by default; future provider-specific patch flow must be explicit |
| Failed notify after `paid` | `paid` | Ignore and log warning |
| Refund notify after `refunded` | `refunded` | Return success without double refunding |
| Partial refund duplicate | `partial_refunded` | Use provider refund id or idempotency key to prevent double counting |

---

## 5. Service Design

### 5.1 InvoiceServiceInterface

**File**: `src/Payment/Service/InvoiceServiceInterface.php`

```php
interface InvoiceServiceInterface extends BaseServiceInterface
{
    public function createInvoice(CreateInvoiceRequest $request): Invoice;

    public function pay(Invoice $invoice, string $payment, array $options = []): PaymentResult;

    public function handleNotifyResult(PaymentNotifyResult $result): Invoice;

    public function markPaid(Invoice $invoice, PaymentNotifyResult $result): Invoice;

    public function markFailed(Invoice $invoice, PaymentNotifyResult $result): Invoice;

    public function cancel(Invoice $invoice, ?string $reason = null): Invoice;

    public function refund(Invoice $invoice, int $amount, string $reason, array $options = []): PaymentRefundResult;

    public function findBySource(string $sourceType, string $sourceId): array;
}
```

### 5.2 InvoiceService Responsibilities

| Responsibility | Detail |
|----------------|--------|
| Create invoices | Assign `uuid`, `outTradeNo`, source fields, amount, currency, payer |
| Validate amount | Reject negative amount and invalid refund amount |
| Apply workflow transitions | Use `state_machine.invoice`, never direct status writes |
| Call gateway registry | Resolve named gateway for pay/refund |
| Handle notify result | Find invoice by `outTradeNo` or transaction id and update safely |
| Apply adjustments | Apply registered payment adjustments before gateway payment request |
| Calculate gateway pay amount | Use `invoice.amount - appliedAdjustmentAmount` as provider charge amount |
| Persist provider snapshots | Store sanitized notify/refund data in `extraData` |
| Dispatch events | Emit invoice domain events after successful state changes |
| Maintain idempotency | Treat duplicate terminal callbacks as successful no-ops |

### 5.3 Payment Adjustment Provider Responsibilities

**File**: `src/Payment/Service/Adjustment/PaymentAdjustmentProviderInterface.php`

PaymentAdjustmentProviderInterface is the extension point for modules that can reduce the amount handled by the selected payment gateway. Payment defines the interface and orchestration rules. Provider implementations live in the owning module, such as Wallet.

```php
interface PaymentAdjustmentProviderInterface
{
    public static function getName(): string;

    public function supports(Invoice $invoice, string $payment, array $options): bool;

    public function apply(PaymentAdjustmentContext $context): PaymentAdjustmentResult;

    /** @return PaymentAdjustmentResult[] */
    public function applied(Invoice $invoice): array;

    public function release(Invoice $invoice, PaymentAdjustmentResult $adjustment, string $reason): PaymentAdjustmentResult;

    public function refund(Invoice $invoice, PaymentAdjustmentResult $adjustment, string $reason): PaymentAdjustmentResult;
}
```

| Responsibility | Detail |
|----------------|--------|
| Detect applicability | Decide whether request options ask for this adjustment |
| Validate request | Reject invalid amount, currency, payer, or provider-specific configuration |
| Apply adjustment | Perform provider-owned mutation, such as wallet transfer |
| Query applied adjustments | Return applied generic adjustment results for notify/refund validation |
| Enforce idempotency | Use stable provider reference ids such as `invoice-adjustment-{provider}-{invoice.uuid}` |
| Release adjustment | Reverse an applied adjustment when gateway payment creation fails or unpaid invoice is cancelled |
| Refund adjustment | Reverse an applied adjustment when a paid invoice is refunded |
| Hide internals | Return only generic amount/reference/payload data to Payment |

First phase MUST support only one wallet balance adjustment per invoice. Future adjustment types such as coupons or points must be added through the same provider interface and should not require gateway changes.

`InvoiceService` MUST obtain applied adjustment totals through providers or the adjustment registry. It MUST NOT query wallet deduction entities directly.

### 5.4 Payment Adjustment Flow

Invoice payment with adjustments follows this sequence:

```text
InvoiceService::pay(invoice, payment, options)
  -> PaymentAdjustmentRegistry resolves applicable providers
  -> apply each provider and collect PaymentAdjustmentResult values
  -> compute gatewayAmount = invoice.amount - appliedAdjustmentAmount
  -> if gatewayAmount == 0: mark invoice paid without calling an external gateway
  -> if gatewayAmount > 0: call gateway->pay(invoice, gatewayAmount, options)
  -> gateway returns PaymentResult
  -> provider notify later confirms gatewayAmount
  -> InvoiceService::markPaid() verifies notify amount plus applied adjustments covers invoice.amount
```

If an adjustment succeeds but gateway payment creation fails, InvoiceService MUST call `PaymentAdjustmentProviderInterface::release()` before surfacing the error.

### 5.5 DTOs

#### CreateInvoiceRequest

```php
final readonly class CreateInvoiceRequest
{
    public function __construct(
        public string $sourceType,
        public string $sourceId,
        public string $scene,
        public int $amount,
        public string $currency = 'CNY',
        public ?User $payer = null,
        public ?string $subject = null,
        public ?string $description = null,
        public array $extraData = [],
    ) {}
}
```

#### PaymentAdjustmentContext

```php
final readonly class PaymentAdjustmentContext
{
    public function __construct(
        public Invoice $invoice,
        public string $payment,
        public int $invoiceAmount,
        public string $currency,
        public array $options = [],
    ) {}
}
```

#### PaymentAdjustmentResult

```php
final readonly class PaymentAdjustmentResult
{
    public function __construct(
        public string $provider,
        public int $amount,
        public string $currency,
        public string $referenceId,
        public array $payload = [],
    ) {}
}
```

First-phase wallet adjustment values:

| Field | Valid Value |
|-------|-------------|
| `provider` | `wallet_balance` |
| `currency` | Same as invoice currency |

#### PaymentResult

```php
final readonly class PaymentResult
{
    public function __construct(
        public Invoice $invoice,
        public string $status,
        public ?string $payUrl = null,
        public ?string $qrCode = null,
        public ?array $payload = null,
        public ?string $message = null,
    ) {}
}
```

#### PaymentNotifyResult

```php
final readonly class PaymentNotifyResult
{
    public function __construct(
        public string $payment,
        public string $outTradeNo,
        public string $status,
        public int $amount,
        public string $currency = 'CNY',
        public ?string $transactionId = null,
        public ?\DateTimeImmutable $paidAt = null,
        public array $rawData = [],
        public string $responseBody = 'SUCCESS',
    ) {}
}
```

#### PaymentRefundResult

```php
final readonly class PaymentRefundResult
{
    public function __construct(
        public Invoice $invoice,
        public int $amount,
        public string $status,
        public ?string $refundId = null,
        public array $rawData = [],
    ) {}
}
```

---

## 6. Gateway Framework

### 6.1 Gateway Interface

**File**: `src/Payment/Service/PaymentGatewayInterface.php`

```php
interface PaymentGatewayInterface
{
    public static function getName(): string;

    public function pay(Invoice $invoice, int $amount, array $options = []): PaymentResult;

    public function notify(Request $request): PaymentNotifyResult;

    public function refund(Invoice $invoice, int $amount, int $paidAmount, string $reason, array $options = []): PaymentRefundResult;

    public function getNotifySuccessResponse(PaymentNotifyResult $result): Response;
}
```

Gateway adapters MUST treat the explicit `$amount` argument as the amount to process. They MUST NOT derive the payable amount from `Invoice::amount` when an explicit amount is provided, and MUST NOT inspect adjustment or deduction options.

For payment:

```php
$gateway->pay($invoice, $gatewayAmount, $options);
```

For refund:

```php
$gateway->refund($invoice, $gatewayRefundAmount, $gatewayPaidAmount, $reason, $options);
```

`Invoice::amount` remains the gross business payable amount. The gateway payment/refund amounts are computed by `InvoiceService` after applying generic payment adjustments.

### 6.2 Gateway And Adjustment Registration

Gateway and adjustment provider implementations MUST be registered through tagged iterators.

```yaml
services:
    _instanceof:
        App\Payment\Service\PaymentGatewayInterface:
            tags: ['payment.gateway']

        App\Payment\Service\Adjustment\PaymentAdjustmentProviderInterface:
            tags: ['payment.adjustment_provider']
```

Gateway implementations may live in Payment for generic/provider adapters, in Wallet for internal wallet payment, or in provider modules such as Wechat. Registration is based on the interface tag, not a single namespace scan.

```php
final class PaymentGatewayRegistry
{
    /** @param iterable<PaymentGatewayInterface> $gateways */
    public function __construct(iterable $gateways) {}

    public function get(string $name): PaymentGatewayInterface {}

    public function has(string $name): bool {}

    public function names(): array {}
}
```

```php
final class PaymentAdjustmentRegistry
{
    /** @param iterable<PaymentAdjustmentProviderInterface> $providers */
    public function __construct(iterable $providers) {}

    /** @return PaymentAdjustmentProviderInterface[] */
    public function applicable(Invoice $invoice, string $payment, array $options): array {}

    /** @return PaymentAdjustmentResult[] */
    public function applied(Invoice $invoice): array {}
}
```

### 6.3 First-Phase Gateways

| Gateway | Purpose | Required |
|---------|---------|----------|
| `mock` | Deterministic test/development gateway | Yes |
| `wallet` | Internal wallet balance payment implemented in Wallet module and tagged as `payment.gateway` | Yes if Wallet module remains payment-capable |
| `wechat` | WeChat Pay adapter implemented in Wechat module and tagged as `payment.gateway` | Optional/provider-dependent |

`mock` is a fake external gateway for tests and local development. It does not move wallet funds and must not be treated as wallet payment. It simulates provider pay/notify/refund behavior and is useful for validating invoice workflow, adjustments, and Trade integration without real provider credentials.

When used with adjustments, `mock` notify amount MUST equal the explicit gateway payment amount, not the invoice gross amount.

### 6.4 Future Provider Gateways

Future provider adapters MUST live under Payment gateway namespaces and MUST NOT be standalone legacy bundles.

```
src/Payment/Service/Gateway/Fuiou/
|-- FuiouGateway.php
|-- FuiouPosGateway.php
|-- FuiouClient.php
|-- FuiouSigner.php
|-- FuiouNotifyParser.php

src/Payment/Service/Gateway/Huifu/
|-- HuifuGateway.php
|-- HuifuPosGateway.php
|-- HuifuClient.php
|-- HuifuSigner.php
|-- HuifuNotifyParser.php
```

Provider-specific account, POS, and withdraw features MUST be implemented later as optional provider submodules, not as first-phase invoice framework.

---

## 7. Webhook Design

### 7.1 Routes

Webhook endpoints are intentionally outside `/api/v1` business routes because they are called by providers.

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| POST | `/api/payment/notify/{payment}` | Generic provider payment notification |
| POST | `/api/payment/refund-notify/{payment}` | Optional provider refund notification |

### 7.2 Controller Contract

**File**: `src/Payment/Controller/Webhook/PaymentNotifyController.php`

Controller responsibilities:

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Resolve gateway by `{payment}` |
| 2 | Call `$gateway->notify($request)` |
| 3 | Pass result to `InvoiceService::handleNotifyResult()` |
| 4 | Return `$gateway->getNotifySuccessResponse($result)` |
| 5 | Convert verification errors to provider-compatible failure response |

The controller MUST NOT update `Order`, `Wallet`, or other business module entities.

### 7.3 Notify Verification

Every gateway notify parser MUST verify:

| Check | Requirement |
|-------|-------------|
| Signature | Required for external gateways |
| Merchant id | Must match configured merchant |
| Amount | Must equal expected gateway pay amount: `invoice.amount - appliedAdjustmentAmount` |
| Currency | Must match invoice currency when provider sends it |
| Trade number | Must map to invoice `outTradeNo` |
| Transaction id | Must be stored when success is confirmed |

For invoices with applied adjustments, webhook amount verification MUST be performed by `InvoiceService::markPaid()`, not by business modules. Business modules should receive only the final `InvoicePaidEvent`.

---

## 8. Event Contract

### 8.1 Events

| Event | Emitted By | When |
|-------|------------|------|
| `InvoicePaidEvent` | `InvoiceService::markPaid()` | Invoice first reaches `paid` |
| `InvoiceRefundedEvent` | `InvoiceService::refund()` or refund notify | Invoice reaches `refunded` or `partial_refunded` |
| `InvoiceCancelledEvent` | `InvoiceService::cancel()` | Invoice reaches `cancelled` |
| `InvoiceFailedEvent` | `InvoiceService::markFailed()` | Invoice reaches `failed` |

### 8.2 Event Payload

```php
final class InvoicePaidEvent
{
    public function __construct(private readonly Invoice $invoice) {}

    public function getInvoice(): Invoice {}
}
```

Events MAY include the relevant DTO result if the consumer needs provider details.

### 8.3 Business Module Reaction

Business modules react to invoice events. Payment MUST NOT call Trade directly.

| Consumer | Event | Action |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Trade | `InvoicePaidEvent` | Apply order `pay` transition after validating amount and source |
| Trade | `InvoiceRefundedEvent` | Apply order `refund` transition when full refund is confirmed |
| Trade | `InvoiceCancelledEvent` | Optionally cancel unpaid order invoice reference |

---

## 9. Trade Integration

### 9.1 Source Mapping

Trade orders use these invoice source values:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| `sourceType` | `trade_order` |
| `sourceId` | `Order::getUuid()` preferred |
| `scene` | `order` |
| `amount` | `Order::getTotalAmount()` |
| `currency` | `Order::getCurrency()` |

### 9.2 Order Fields

Trade `Order` SHOULD store lightweight invoice references only:

| Field | Type | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| `invoiceId` | ?string | Payment invoice uuid or id as string |
| `invoiceNo` | ?string | Invoice `outTradeNo` for display and lookup |
| `paymentStatus` | ?string | Cached invoice status for list views |

Trade MUST NOT require an ORM `ManyToOne` relation to `Payment\Entity\Invoice` in the first phase.

Trade MUST NOT model or persist adjustment internals. When wallet balance deduction is used, Payment still emits a normal `InvoicePaidEvent` after `invoice.amount` is fully covered by gateway payment plus applied adjustments.

### 9.3 Payment Request Flow

```
POST /api/v1/app/orders/{id}/payment
  -> Trade OrderController validates owner and order status
  -> Trade OrderService calls InvoiceServiceInterface::createInvoice()
  -> Trade OrderService calls InvoiceServiceInterface::pay()
  -> Payment gateway returns PaymentResult
  -> response contains invoice and payment instructions
```

### 9.4 Payment Confirm Flow

```
Provider webhook or wallet success
  -> PaymentNotifyController
  -> Gateway::notify()
  -> InvoiceService::handleNotifyResult()
  -> invoice workflow mark_paid
  -> dispatch InvoicePaidEvent
  -> Trade listener validates source/amount/currency
  -> order workflow pay
  -> OrderService persists paidAt/paymentMethod/paymentStatus
```

For invoices with adjustments, Trade still validates `invoice.amount == order.totalAmount`. Adjustments are internal to payment orchestration and should not alter Trade's amount comparison.

### 9.5 Refund Flow

```
POST /api/v1/manage/orders/{id}/refund
  -> Trade validates order can refund
  -> Trade calls InvoiceServiceInterface::refund()
  -> Payment gateway refunds external pay amount
  -> Payment adjustment providers refund applied adjustments when present
  -> invoice workflow partial_refund/refund
  -> dispatch InvoiceRefundedEvent
  -> Trade listener applies order refund transition when full refund is confirmed
```

First-phase wallet adjustment support SHOULD only allow full invoice refund when an adjustment exists. Partial refund allocation between gateway payment and wallet deduction is explicitly out of scope.

### 9.6 Trade Listener Contract

**File**: `src/Trade/EventListener/OrderInvoiceListener.php`

The listener MUST:

| Rule | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| T-PAY-1 | Ignore invoices whose `sourceType` is not `trade_order` |
| T-PAY-2 | Find order by `sourceId` |
| T-PAY-3 | Validate invoice amount equals order total amount |
| T-PAY-4 | Validate invoice currency equals order currency |
| T-PAY-5 | Apply order workflow transition only if `can()` returns true |
| T-PAY-6 | Treat duplicate paid events as idempotent no-ops |
| T-PAY-7 | Persist order through `OrderService`, not direct EntityManager logic in listener |

## 10. API Design

### 10.1 App Endpoints

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| GET | `/api/v1/app/invoices` | List current user's invoices |
| GET | `/api/v1/app/invoices/{id}` | Invoice detail |
| POST | `/api/v1/app/invoices/{id}/pay/{payment}` | Start payment for an invoice |

### 10.2 Manage Endpoints

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| GET | `/api/v1/manage/invoices` | Admin invoice list |
| GET | `/api/v1/manage/invoices/{id}` | Admin invoice detail |
| POST | `/api/v1/manage/invoices` | Admin create invoice, mostly for manual/testing use |
| POST | `/api/v1/manage/invoices/{id}/pay/{payment}` | Admin start payment |
| POST | `/api/v1/manage/invoices/{id}/cancel` | Cancel unpaid invoice |
| POST | `/api/v1/manage/invoices/{id}/refund` | Refund paid invoice |
| GET | `/api/v1/manage/invoices/{id}/transitions` | Available invoice transitions |

### 10.3 Trade Convenience Endpoints

Trade MAY expose convenience routes that call Payment services:

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| POST | `/api/v1/app/orders/{id}/payment` | Create/start invoice payment for order |
| POST | `/api/v1/manage/orders/{id}/payment` | Admin create/start order payment |
| POST | `/api/v1/manage/orders/{id}/refund` | Refund order through linked invoice |

### 10.4 Adjustment Request Payload

Payment endpoints MAY accept adjustment options and pass them to registered adjustment providers. First phase supports only one wallet balance deduction in the invoice currency, implemented by the Wallet module.

Shortcut payload for App clients:

```json
{
  "payment": "wechat",
  "walletAmount": 3000,
  "tradeType": "jsapi"
}
```

Structured payload for future extensibility:

```json
{
  "payment": "wechat",
  "deduction": {
    "type": "wallet_balance",
    "amount": 3000,
    "currency": "CNY"
  },
  "tradeType": "jsapi"
}
```

Rules:

| Rule | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| ADJ-API-1 | Wallet adjustment provider may accept `walletAmount` or structured `deduction.type = wallet_balance` |
| ADJ-API-2 | Adjustment amount must be `> 0` and `<= invoice.amount` |
| ADJ-API-3 | Adjustment currency must equal invoice currency |
| ADJ-API-4 | Full wallet deduction sets `invoice.payment = wallet` and skips external gateway calls |
| ADJ-API-5 | Partial wallet deduction keeps requested external `payment` and passes the remaining explicit amount to the gateway |

### 10.5 Response Envelope

All Payment API endpoints MUST use the standard response envelope:

```json
{
  "data": {},
  "code": 200,
  "message": "SUCCESS"
}
```

Webhook endpoints are the exception: they MAY return provider-required raw text/XML/JSON responses.

---

## 11. Configuration

### 11.1 Package Config

**File**: `config/packages/payment.yaml`

```yaml
payment:
    default_currency: 'CNY'
    system_wallet_id: 0
    gateways:
        mock:
            enabled: true
        wallet:
            enabled: true
    adjustments:
        wallet_balance:
            enabled: true
```

### 11.2 Future Provider Config Shape

Provider configuration shape is reserved but not implemented in the first phase:

```yaml
payment:
    gateways:
        fuiou:
            enabled: '%env(bool:PAYMENT_FUIOU_ENABLED)%'
            merchant_id: '%env(PAYMENT_FUIOU_MERCHANT_ID)%'
            merchant_key: '%env(PAYMENT_FUIOU_MERCHANT_KEY)%'
            notify_url: '%env(PAYMENT_FUIOU_NOTIFY_URL)%'
        huifu:
            enabled: '%env(bool:PAYMENT_HUIFU_ENABLED)%'
            sys_id: '%env(PAYMENT_HUIFU_SYS_ID)%'
            private_key: '%env(PAYMENT_HUIFU_PRIVATE_KEY)%'
            public_key: '%env(PAYMENT_HUIFU_PUBLIC_KEY)%'
            platform_public_key: '%env(PAYMENT_HUIFU_PLATFORM_PUBLIC_KEY)%'
```

Sensitive provider values MUST come from environment variables and MUST NOT be committed.

---

## 12. Transaction Contract

### 12.1 Service-Level Transactions

Payment mutations MUST be managed in the service layer.

| Operation | Transaction Boundary |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Create invoice | `InvoiceService::createInvoice()` |
| Apply payment adjustments | `PaymentAdjustmentProviderInterface::apply()` using provider-owned idempotency |
| Start wallet payment | `InvoiceService::pay()` and `WalletGateway` transfer service |
| Handle webhook | `InvoiceService::handleNotifyResult()` |
| Refund invoice | `InvoiceService::refund()` plus adjustment provider refunds when adjustments exist |

### 12.1.1 Adjustment Transaction Rules

| Scenario | Rule |
|----------|------|
| Adjustment applied, gateway pay succeeds | Keep adjustment applied; invoice remains `paying` until notify or immediate paid result |
| Adjustment applied, gateway pay creation fails | Call the provider `release()` before returning error |
| Full wallet deduction | Mark invoice paid with `payment = wallet`; do not call external gateway |
| Paid invoice refund | Refund external gateway pay amount first, then refund wallet deduction |
| Unpaid invoice cancel | Release applied adjustments |

Wallet adjustment transfer reference ids MUST be stable and idempotent. Recommended first-phase references:

```text
invoice-adjustment-wallet-balance-{invoice.uuid}
invoice-adjustment-wallet-balance-release-{invoice.uuid}
invoice-adjustment-wallet-balance-refund-{invoice.uuid}
```

### 12.2 Cross-Module Consistency

Payment and Trade SHOULD NOT attempt a distributed transaction.

Instead:

| Concern | Mechanism |
|---------|-----------|
| Invoice paid persisted but order update fails | Event listener logs failure and retry command can replay invoice event |
| Duplicate provider callback | Invoice idempotency rules |
| Order already paid | Trade listener no-op if order is already paid |
| Amount mismatch | Trade listener rejects transition and logs critical error |

### 12.3 Webhook Locking

Webhook handling SHOULD use one of these idempotency mechanisms:

| Mechanism | Use |
|-----------|-----|
| Unique `outTradeNo` | Locate invoice |
| Provider `transactionId` | Prevent duplicate provider success processing |
| Optional lock key | `payment_notify_{payment}_{outTradeNo}` |
| Stored raw event id | Future provider-specific duplicate detection |

---

## 13. Error Handling

### 13.1 Exceptions

| Exception | When |
|-----------|------|
| `PaymentGatewayNotFoundException` | Unknown gateway name |
| `PaymentVerificationException` | Signature or provider payload verification fails |
| `InvoiceInvalidTransitionException` | Workflow transition is not allowed |
| `InvoiceAmountMismatchException` | Notify/refund amount does not match invoice rules |

All exceptions MUST be thrown by services or gateway adapters, never by entities.

### 13.2 Controller Mapping

Business API controllers convert exceptions to `warning()` responses.

Webhook controllers return provider-compatible failure responses when verification fails.

---

## 14. Security

### 14.1 App and Manage APIs

| Scope | Security |
|-------|----------|
| `/api/v1/app/invoices*` | Authenticated user, scoped to payer/source ownership |
| `/api/v1/manage/invoices*` | `ROLE_ADMIN` |
| Trade convenience endpoints | Same as existing Trade route security |

### 14.2 Webhook APIs

Webhook endpoints are publicly reachable but MUST verify provider signatures or shared secrets.

Rules:

| Rule | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| W1 | Never trust request body before verification |
| W2 | Log sanitized payloads only |
| W3 | Do not log secret keys, signatures with private material, access tokens, or full PII |
| W4 | Webhook must be idempotent |
| W5 | Webhook response must follow provider protocol |

---

## 15. Provider Adapter Framework Reference

### 15.1 Fuiou/Huifu Lessons

The legacy provider bundles demonstrate that a provider integration may contain several independent capabilities:

| Capability | Examples | First Phase |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| Payment collection | Fuiou/Huifu normal pay, POS pay | Framework only |
| Payment notify | Signature verification and status mapping | Framework only |
| Refund | Provider refund API | Framework only |
| Account onboarding | Fuiou/Huifu account entities | Excluded |
| POS device management | POS terminal entities | Excluded |
| Withdraw/settlement | Auto withdraw commands | Excluded |

### 15.2 Future Provider Structure

Provider collection adapters SHOULD be implemented as gateway services:

```text
Payment\Service\Gateway\Fuiou\FuiouGateway
Payment\Service\Gateway\Fuiou\FuiouPosGateway
Payment\Service\Gateway\Huifu\HuifuGateway
Payment\Service\Gateway\Huifu\HuifuPosGateway
```

Provider account modules MAY be added later:

```text
Payment\Provider\Fuiou\Entity\FuiouAccount
Payment\Provider\Fuiou\Entity\FuiouPosDevice
Payment\Provider\Huifu\Entity\HuifuAccount
Payment\Provider\Huifu\Entity\HuifuPosDevice
```

Provider account modules MUST NOT be required for generic invoice payment.

---

## 16. Testing Contract

### 16.1 Unit Tests

| Test | Coverage |
|------|----------|
| `InvoiceTest` | Status constants, timestamps, amount/refund getters, `__toString()` |
| `PaymentGatewayRegistryTest` | Resolve gateway, unknown gateway exception, names list |
| `InvoiceServiceTest` | Create invoice, pay, mark paid, cancel, refund validation |
| `PaymentAdjustmentProviderTest` | Apply/release/refund adjustment validation and idempotency |
| `MockGatewayTest` | Pay/notify/refund deterministic behavior |
| `WalletGatewayTest` | Wallet transfer success/failure mapping |

### 16.2 Integration Tests

| Test | Coverage |
|------|----------|
| `PaymentApiIntegrationTest` | App/manage invoice list/detail/pay/refund endpoints |
| `PaymentWebhookIntegrationTest` | Webhook success, invalid signature, duplicate notify |
| `TradePaymentIntegrationTest` | Order payment creates invoice and paid event updates order |
| `TradeRefundIntegrationTest` | Order refund through invoice updates both modules |
| `PaymentAdjustmentIntegrationTest` | Wallet balance deduction plus mock/external payment amount marks invoice/order paid |

### 16.3 Regression Cases

| Case | Expected |
|------|----------|
| Duplicate paid notify | No duplicate order transition |
| Notify amount mismatch | Invoice not marked paid; warning/failed handling logged |
| Refund more than paid | Rejected |
| Pay cancelled invoice | Rejected |
| Unknown gateway | 400 warning for API, provider failure response for webhook |
| Adjustment currency mismatch | Rejected before wallet transfer |
| Adjustment amount exceeds invoice amount | Rejected before wallet transfer |
| Wallet adjustment + mock payment | Mock notify amount must equal remaining explicit gateway amount |
| Full wallet deduction | Invoice payment is `wallet` and no external gateway is called |
| Gateway pay failure after adjustment | Adjustment is released via provider reversal |
| Adjusted invoice full refund | External payment amount and wallet deduction are both refunded |

---

## 17. Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Invoice Framework

1. Create `Payment` module skeleton.
2. Add `Invoice` entity and repository.
3. Add invoice workflow configuration.
4. Add DTOs and exceptions.
5. Add `PaymentGatewayInterface` and `PaymentGatewayRegistry`.
6. Add `InvoiceServiceInterface` and `InvoiceService`.
7. Add `MockGateway`.
8. Add App/Manage invoice controllers.
9. Add webhook controller.
10. Add unit and integration tests.

### Phase 2: Wallet Gateway and Trade Integration

1. Add Wallet-owned `WalletGateway` using `TransferServiceInterface`.
2. Add lightweight invoice reference fields to `Trade\Entity\Order`.
3. Add Trade payment convenience endpoint.
4. Add `OrderInvoiceListener` for invoice paid/refunded events.
5. Replace direct wallet payment route with Payment-backed path or keep direct path temporarily behind explicit compatibility.
6. Add Trade payment integration tests.

### Phase 3: Payment Adjustments and Wallet Balance Deduction

1. Add `PaymentAdjustmentProviderInterface`, `PaymentAdjustmentRegistry`, `PaymentAdjustmentContext`, and `PaymentAdjustmentResult` under Payment.
2. Add Wallet-owned wallet balance adjustment provider for first-phase `wallet_balance` deduction in invoice currency.
3. Let Wallet own any wallet deduction entity/repository required for audit, idempotency, wallet transaction ids, release, and refund reversal.
4. Update `InvoiceService::pay()` to apply registered adjustments before gateway payment and pass the explicit remaining amount to gateways.
5. Update `InvoiceService::markPaid()` to verify `notify.amount == invoice.amount - appliedAdjustmentAmount`.
6. Update `InvoiceService::refund()` to refund external gateway amount and ask adjustment providers to refund their applied adjustments for full refunds.
7. Update gateway interfaces and implementations so `MockGateway`, `WalletGateway`, `WechatPayGateway`, and provider gateways receive explicit amounts and do not read `$options['payAmount']`.
8. Update Trade payment convenience endpoints to accept `walletAmount` and structured `deduction` payloads as Wallet adjustment input.
9. Add adjustment unit and integration tests.

### Phase 4: Provider Adapter Readiness

1. Define provider config schema for external gateways.
2. Add abstract signer/parser client patterns if needed.
3. Add provider adapter tests with fake payloads.
4. Document required certification/manual verification steps.

### Phase 5: Fuiou/Huifu Providers

This phase is intentionally out of first implementation scope.

When started, migrate only provider payment gateway responsibilities first:

1. `FuiouGateway` and `FuiouPosGateway`.
2. `HuifuGateway` and `HuifuPosGateway`.
3. Signature verification helpers.
4. Notify payload parsers.
5. Refund request helpers.
6. Provider-specific raw response formatting.

Do not migrate account onboarding, POS management, or auto withdraw in this phase unless explicitly required.

## 18. Open Questions

| Question | Default Decision |
|----------|------------------|
| Should invoice source id use order id or uuid? | Use order uuid for external stability |
| Should invoice relate to User directly? | Optional `payer`, plus source metadata |
| Should Trade hold ORM relation to Invoice? | No, store lightweight invoice reference fields |
| Should provider gateway update Order directly? | No, events only |
| Should Fuiou/Huifu be standalone bundles? | No, future gateway adapters under Payment |
| Should PaymentRequisition be included? | No, separate Finance/Approval module later |
| Should wallet balance deduction be owned by Payment? | No, Wallet owns wallet deduction internals and implements Payment adjustment provider |
| Which adjustment type is implemented first? | Only `wallet_balance` for the invoice currency |
| How should full wallet deduction be recorded? | Set `invoice.payment = wallet` and mark invoice paid after deduction applies |
| Should deducted invoices support partial refund first? | No, only full refund until allocation rules are designed |

---

## 19. Acceptance Criteria

The Payment module design is implemented when:

| Criteria | Requirement |
|----------|-------------|
| Invoice entity | Exists with cents-based amount and workflow status |
| Gateway registry | Resolves tagged gateways by name |
| Mock gateway | Supports deterministic pay/notify/refund tests |
| Webhook | Updates invoice through service, not controller logic |
| Events | Invoice paid/refunded/cancelled events dispatched |
| Trade integration | Order can be paid through invoice event flow |
| Adjustment | Payment supports generic adjustment providers; Wallet supports first-phase `wallet_balance` deduction without gateway `payAmount` coupling |
| Tests | Unit and integration tests cover idempotency and invalid transitions |
| CI | Coverage remains at or above required threshold |
